Build machine Learning model(classification) for the fruits dataset listed below
Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mjamilmoughal/fruits-with-colors-dataset
Do data ingestion (convert dataset into dataframe)
Do some preprocessing(if required)
Identify the input and output columns. Remove the unwanted columns.
Build multiple ML models(use different classification algorithms) and compare the accuracies.(Google the best classification algorithms and use a few common ones here).
Evaluate the model.
